                I love my calendar. But a recurring problem that I have is that
                when tasks become monotonous and I have a repeating event (like
                working out oops üò≥) I‚Äôll skip it. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it tomorrow,‚Äù I say‚Ä¶
                and then I say it again the next day‚Ä¶ and the next day‚Ä¶ you get
                the point.

                While I think that it is a great idea to have a week-by-week,
                month-by-month schedule for big picture things, what you accomplish
                on a day to day is a much more detailed process. When I‚Äôm planning
                my weeks on my calendar app on my phone, I have a habit of filling
                every free spot with something to do, and when that day comes I
                realize that I had forgotten to leave a spot open to eat lunch, or
                take into account a small travel time.

                My hope for Just Do It Tomorrow is that we can all take a
                little more time to plan our tasks day by day for the day
                we want. A big motivator for this idea comes from a lecture
                by Jordan Peterson, included at the bottom. I hope you
                enjoy using this planner, and let me know if you notice any
                bugs, or have suggestions for features!
